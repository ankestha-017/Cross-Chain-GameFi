## Project Vision
The vision of Cross-Chain GameFi is to empower a new generation of blockchain games by bridging the gaps between disparate networks. This project aims to:
- Enhance user experience by enabling cross-chain interactions.
- Facilitate true ownership and transferability of game assets.
- Create a robust framework for developers to build interoperable GameFi applications.

## Key Features
- **Asset Creation**: Users can mint unique game assets tied to metadata and a specific blockchain.
- **Cross-Chain Transfer**: Seamlessly transfer assets across different blockchain networks while preserving ownership integrity.
- **Secure Ownership**: The contract ensures that only asset owners can manage or transfer their assets.
- **Developer Friendly**: Provides a reliable foundation for GameFi developers to create interoperable applications.

## Deployment
This smart contract is written in Solidity and can be deployed on any EVM-compatible blockchain such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Polygon.
